#  Stress Level Predictor

A machine learning–based web application that predicts a user's **stress level
(Low / Medium / High)** using lifestyle factors such as sleep hours, work hours,
physical activity, and screen time.

This project showcases **end-to-end Machine Learning application development**
using **Random Forest** and **Streamlit**.

---

##  Key Features

- Stress level prediction using a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Clean and interactive **Streamlit UI**
- Color-coded stress level output
- Personalized **stress management tips**
- Offline model evaluation using standard ML metrics

---

##  Machine Learning Overview

- **Problem Type:** Multi-class Classification  
- **Target Variable:** Stress Level (Low, Medium, High)  
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Why Random Forest?**
  - Better generalization than a single decision tree
  - Handles non-linear patterns effectively
  - Suitable for real-world ML applications
